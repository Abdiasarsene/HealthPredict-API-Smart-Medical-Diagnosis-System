## 🎯 Goal : Designed for critical medical diagnosis workflows

* Predictive diagnosis for common and rare conditions
* Risk estimation based on structured medical data
* Dual-model architecture: Ray Serve for scalability + FastAPI fallback for robustness
* Modular pipelines for retraining and model versioning

---

## 🧠 Stack Used

* **Ray Serve**: distributed model serving → horizontal scalability for real-time predictions
* **FastAPI**: async-ready API layer → minimal latency, high throughput, fallback support
* **MLflow**: model lifecycle management → reproducibility, traceability, experiment tracking
* **BentoML**: fallback deployment → resilience under model or service failure
* **Prometheus + Grafana**: telemetry and alerting → operational visibility and drift detection
* **Jenkins CI/CD**: automated build and deploy → reproducible integration and delivery

💡 Each tool was chosen for **robustness, reliability, and maintainability**, not just aesthetics.

## 📖 Backend Narrative

*"Patient data is ingested, validated, and preprocessed using robust encoding and normalization pipelines. Dual predictive models (diagnosis & treatment) are trained, versioned, and tracked via MLflow. Ray Serve delivers predictions in real-time while FastAPI ensures a fallback route for service continuity. Prometheus/Grafana monitor API latency, model drift, and request health, with CI/CD orchestrated by Jenkins. Retraining and evaluation pipelines are modular and ready for Airflow integration."*

## 📊 Operational Impact

* **>95% accuracy** in diagnosis predictions
* **<120ms latency** per prediction under production load
* **Auto-fallback** ensures uninterrupted service
* **Live monitoring** of model drift, API health, and data quality

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

* **Integration** of **real-time patient vitals** for dynamic risk scoring
* **Multi-model ensemble** for rare and complex diagnoses
* **Federated learning** across hospitals for privacy-preserving insights
* **Explainable AI** dashboards for clinicians and regulatory compliance
* **Telemedicine integration** for remote diagnostic support

---

## 🏁 Final Note

*"HealthPredict demonstrates how medical AI can be production-ready, modular, and reliable. The models are here, the architecture is solid — how far you take patient care is up to you."*
